# Slow Spec

Research the codebase and write a detailed specification with milestones
for complex, multi-step work.

**CRITICAL: This skill is PLANNING ONLY. Do NOT write code, edit source
files, run tests, create branches, or execute any implementation work.
Your only output is the spec file, research files, and a summary for
the user. Use `/do-spec` to execute an approved spec.**

## Inputs

`$ARGUMENTS` — A description of the work.

## Process

### Phase 1: Research

1. Generate a short kebab-case slug from the description.
2. Create `.wip/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/` and `.wip/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/research/`.
3. Identify the distinct research questions or areas to investigate.
4. For each area, kick off a **researcher agent**. Each agent
   writes its own file in `research/` using a kebab-case slug:
   - e.g. `research/auth-patterns.md`, `research/database-schema.md`
   - Each file follows the research template (see below).
   - Agents can run in parallel — separate files prevent conflicts.
5. After all research agents complete, read the research files and
   synthesize findings for Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Write the spec

1. Write `spec.md` using the slow template (see below).
2. Include a research summary referencing files in `research/`.
3. Break the work into milestones. Each milestone:
   - Is a single logical unit resulting in one commit.
   - Is small enough to review meaningfully.
   - Builds on the previous milestone.
   - Includes: files affected, approach, gate criteria, commit message.
   - Includes a progress checklist: `Dev done`, `Reviewed & approved`, `Committed`.
     These track the lifecycle of each milestone — do not skip them.

### Phase 3: Present for review

```
## Spec: [Title]

**Branch:** `feat/<slug>`
**Spec:** `.wip/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/spec.md`

**Research Summary:**
[Key findings in 3-5 bullets]

**Milestones:**
- M1: [description] — `type(scope): message`
- M2: [description] — `type(scope): message`
- M3: [description] — `type(scope): message`

**Risks:**
- [Risk and mitigation]

Approve this spec? Any changes?
```

**⏸ STOP — Wait for user approval.**

If changes requested, update and present again.
When approved, update spec status to `approved`.
