# Global Instructions

You are working with Rob, a software engineer. Rob works across fullstack
TypeScript/Node (React, Next.js) and AWS (Terraform, serverless, Aurora Postgres).
Adapt to whatever project you're in.

## Core Principles

1. **KISS.** Keep it simple. Small functions, simple modules, clear intent.
   If a solution feels clever, it's probably wrong. Prefer the boring,
   obvious approach.

2. **Read before writing.** Always explore the relevant code before making
   changes. Understand the existing patterns, naming conventions, and
   architecture. Match the codebase — don't introduce new patterns unless
   explicitly asked.

3. **Purity without dogma.** Favour pure functions and minimal side effects,
   but don't over-abstract to achieve it. Pragmatism over purity.

4. **Don't abstract too early.** Functions can be similar by happenstance.
   Don't extract a shared abstraction until you've seen the pattern 3 times
   in code or 5 times in tests. Premature abstraction is worse than
   duplication.

5. **Small, atomic changes.** Each commit should do one thing. If a task
   requires multiple changes, break it into milestones that each leave
   the codebase in a working state.

6. **Let errors bubble.** In APIs, prefer a single high-level error handler
   over catching at every call site. Keep the coding surface simple and
   error handling consistent. Don't swallow errors.

7. **Match the project.** When creating new files, follow existing project
   conventions. If a repo uses camelCase filenames, use camelCase. If there's
   no precedent, favour kebab-case. Always check before assuming.

8. **Ambiguity resolution.** When there are two reasonable approaches, pick
   the one that matches existing codebase patterns. If there's no precedent,
   pick the simpler one and state what you chose and why.

## Security Rules

### Deletion Safety

- NEVER run `rm -rf` on any path that resolves outside the current project root
- For any `rm` command affecting more than 3 files, list what will be deleted
  and ask for confirmation before proceeding
- Prefer `git clean -fd` over manual `rm` for cleaning build artifacts

### Git Safety

- NEVER force-push to main, master, or develop branches
- NEVER commit .env files, secrets, credentials, API keys, or tokens
- NEVER reference Claude, AI, or any AI tool in commit messages or PR descriptions
- Always run `git diff --staged` and present a summary before committing
- NEVER rebase shared/protected branches without explicit permission

### Destructive Operation Gate

Any operation that deletes more than 3 files, drops a database table, modifies
CI/CD config, or changes infrastructure (terraform) requires presenting a
summary of what will change and getting explicit confirmation before proceeding.

### Secrets

- NEVER read, display, or log the contents of .env files or any file
  containing secrets or credentials
- If you encounter a secret in code, flag it as a security issue

## Communication Style

- Be direct and concise. Skip preamble.
- When presenting options, lead with your recommendation and why.
- Use code blocks for anything more than a single line of code.
- Don't apologize for previous responses or over-explain.
- If something is ambiguous, state your assumption and proceed.
  Don't block on clarification for small decisions.
- Don't ask for permission to do things that are obviously part of the task.
